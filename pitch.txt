Subject: Sponsorship Request — Free, Open-Source Bitcoin DCA Calculator (btcdollarcostaverage.com)


Hi [Name / Team],

My name is [Your Name], and I built btcdollarcostaverage.com — a free, open-source Bitcoin Dollar Cost Averaging calculator designed to help newcomers understand Bitcoin through real data, not hype.

I'm reaching out to ask if [Organization Name] would consider supporting the project with a small grant or donation to help cover hosting, API costs, and continued development.


WHAT IT DOES

The tool lets anyone plug in an amount (say $50/week), pick a date range, and instantly see what their Bitcoin stack would be worth today using real historical price data from Kraken and Coinbase. No signup, no paywall, no tracking.

Beyond the calculator, the site includes:

- 10 live dashboard widgets (halving countdown, mempool fees, hashrate, Fear & Greed Index, Lightning Network stats, supply scarcity, purchasing power erosion, Bitcoin dominance, live block feed, sat/USD converter)
- Side-by-side comparisons vs S&P 500, Gold, and savings accounts
- Inflation-adjusted returns using Federal Reserve CPI data
- A "Why Bitcoin" educational page covering adoption, network effects, mining costs, and fiat debasement — written for complete beginners
- A satoshi explainer showing what 1 sat could be worth at various BTC price levels
- An adoption tracker comparing Bitcoin's growth curve to early internet adoption
- FIRE calculator, cost basis tracker, exchange fee comparisons, and more

Everything runs on publicly available data. The entire codebase is open source.


WHY IT MATTERS

Most people who hear about Bitcoin still think they need to buy a whole coin. The biggest barrier to adoption isn't skepticism — it's misunderstanding. Tools like this show people, with real numbers, that consistent small purchases add up over time.

Every feature on the site is built to answer the questions newcomers actually ask:
- "Is it too late to buy Bitcoin?"
- "What if I can only afford $20 a week?"
- "How does Bitcoin compare to just leaving my money in a savings account?"
- "What even is a satoshi?"

The calculator answers these with data, not opinions.


WHAT THE SUPPORT WOULD GO TOWARD

- Vercel hosting and bandwidth (the site serves thousands of requests)
- FRED API access for inflation data
- Continued feature development (multi-language support, more educational content, mobile app)
- Keeping the tool ad-light and free for everyone


TRACTION

The site is live at btcdollarcostaverage.com, fully functional, and actively maintained. It scores 90+ on Google Lighthouse across SEO, accessibility, and best practices. The codebase is built with Next.js 16, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS — production-grade infrastructure, not a weekend project.


I'd be happy to add [Organization Name] as a sponsor on the site, include your logo, or collaborate in whatever way makes sense.

Thank you for your time and for the work you do for the Bitcoin ecosystem.

Best,
[Your Name]
